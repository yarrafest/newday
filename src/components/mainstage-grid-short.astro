    <span slot="desc">
      As a singer/song-writer, Annaliese Rose has acquired a charisma and
      writing style well beyond her years. Annaliese released her EP 'Whole' in
      July of 2019. Following the success of her debut EP 'Whole', Annaliese
      released her anticipated second EP, 'More of a Monument Than Ever Before'.
      This sound is somehow sadder than her prior work, yet still comforting and
      familiar to her audience.
