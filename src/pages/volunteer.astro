        The festival is largely run and looked after by volunteers, and the
        festival could not be what it is without your help. A variety of roles
        are available, from helping at the information desk, taking photos,
        manning the artist green rooms to assisting with the bump-in and
        bump-out, weâ€™d love to have you!
