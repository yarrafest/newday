**Vegan Ethiopian food truck.
Enjera is a type of flatbread that is a staple food in Ethiopia and Eritrea.**

It is traditionally made from teff flour, a gluten-free grain that is native to these regions, and is known for its spongy texture and slightly sour taste. It can also be made using other types of grains.
To make enjera, teff flour is mixed with water and left to ferment for a period of time, typically between 1 and 3 days. During this time, natural bacteria in the air and on the teff flour begin to break down the sugars and create gas, which causes the batter to rise and ferment.
The batter is then poured onto a large, hot, circular griddle called a mitad or a mogogo, where it is cooked until the surface is covered in small holes and the edges are crispy. The enjera is then removed from the griddle and stacked, ready to be served with a variety of stews, curries, and other dishes.
Enjera is often used as both a utensil and a plate, with diners using torn pieces of the bread to scoop up the other foods on their plate. It is also commonly eaten on its own, as a snack or breakfast food.
