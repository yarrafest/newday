**Red Herring: The ability to grab peoples attention and become the central point of focus.**

Born from a shared passion of helping Australian businesses succeed.​
Alex and Phil started Red Herring Digital in 2015. Flash forward to today, we’re a blooming digital marketing agency situated in Melbourne’s Inner West.

As the fable goes, Red Herrings are used to train hounds to follow the scent of their target. As your Red Herring, our mission is to keep you following the path to success.

We are more than just your average digital agency. We are adventurous, driven, and want to break boundaries to get you measurable results.
