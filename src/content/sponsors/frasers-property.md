**Kindred is a purpose-built space for creative individuals and organisations in Yarraville, Melbourne. We accommodate musicians, bands, photographers, designers, dancers, actors, artists, entrepreneurs, daring freelancers and more.**

We provide band rehearsal rooms, co-working spaces, private studio suites, recording studio, film and photography studio, dance and yoga studio, bandroom, bar, cafe and function space available for hire. We’re also home to Victoria University Bachelor of Music Degree and many dance and music schools who run their classes out of our studios.

First opened in 2005, we’ve always been privately owned and operated by artists. This could be why Lonely Planet listed us in their Top Ten Workspaces in The World in 2016. More recently, we were awarded the Maribyrnong City Council 2019 Civic Award – Arts Organisation.

Our office is open 9am – 5pm weekdays, the bandroom reception opens 5pm – midnight each week day and we are open 12pm – late on weekends. If you’d like to know more, shoot us a message, visit us in person at 3 Harris St, Yarraville, or call (03) 9689 9859.
