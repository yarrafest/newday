**The Boost Juice Story
Back in 2000, a woman with no business experience – but unlimited passion and family support – opened her first juice bar in Adelaide.**

The idea was brilliantly simple: make healthy living tasty and fun.

The woman was Australian adventurer and entrepreneur Janine Allis. The bar was Boost Juice – now one of the most popular and loved juice and smoothie brands across the globe, with over 580 stores across 13 different countries and counting.
