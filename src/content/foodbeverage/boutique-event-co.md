**We provide mobile cocktail bar service from our Silver Bullet Caravan Bar.**

Boutique Event Co is a mobile bar business, created by local Geelong couple Matt & Dani Fontana. With a passion for weddings, events & damn good service they decided to give Boutique Event Co a crack after their very own backyard wedding. And they haven't looked back! The vintage caravan bars are the ultimate boho dream! They're the perfect addition to any event, with a team of bloody legends behind them making each and every event a memorable one.
